# Hello everyone, my name is Douglas!

## About me
I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering from the University Of Par√° (UFPA) and a Researcher/Developer at LASSE (Telecommunications, Automation and Electronics Research and Development Center), currently working with 5G & IoT Research group in the application of IA (Intelligence Artificial) to improve time synchronization in Telecommunications mobiles networks such 5G and 6G. I have a high interest in the Internet Of Things (IoT) field, such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications protocols (MQTT, LoRa, etc.) and Network tools to connect anything.
